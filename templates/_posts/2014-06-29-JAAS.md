Synopsis:
-----------------
JAAS provides a powerful mechanism for integrating any authentication scheme into a Java application.


Description:
------------------
The process of verifying the identity of a user or another system is authentication. JAAS, as an authentication framework manages the authenticated userâ€™s identity and credentials from login to logout.

The main features being Password stored in SHA-256 hash,Incermental time based lockout,Authentication against a DB using JDBC for users and roles. 

The process have been explained in the Tomcat MOdule below.

For more details: [OWASP JAAS Timed Login Module](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/JAAS_Timed_Login_Module) 

Mitigation:
-----------------
- The OWASP JAAS Timed Login Module is an implementation of a JAAS LoginModule that provides an escalating time based lockout facility and authentication against a database. This could be used to prevent brute force attacks against the authentication service.

- A LoginModule should have the following authentication modules such as initialize(), login(), commit(), abort(), logout(). The details of all these modules are given in the cheat sheet attached below.

- The callbackHandler is in a source (.java) file separate from any single LoginModule so that it can service a multitude of LoginModules with differing callback objects.
