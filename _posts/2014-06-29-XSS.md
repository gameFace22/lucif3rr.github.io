XSS

Synopsis:
---------------
Cross site scripting is a vulnerability in which malicious scripts are injected into the websites which can lead to a total breach of security when customer details are stolen or manipulated.

Description: 
------------------
XSS can be found anywhere in an application where user input has been taken but not properly encoded. The injected script will be sent to users when the browser executes the script, and a malicious action is performed on the client side which can be used to steal credentials. 

For more information on XSS:-
[OWASP guide on XSS](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Cross-site_Scripting_(XSS)) 

Mitigation: 
-------------

- The preferred option is to properly escape all untrusted data based on the HTML context (body, attribute, JavaScript, CSS, or URL) that the data will be placed into. See the [OWASP XSS Prevention Cheat Sheet](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/XSS_(Cross_Site_Scripting)_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet) for details on the required data escaping techniques.

- Positive or “whitelist” input validation is also recommended as it helps protect against XSS, but is not a complete defense as many applications require special characters in their input. Such validation should, as much as possible, validate the length, characters, format, and business rules on that data before accepting the input.

- For rich content, consider auto-sanitization libraries like OWASP’s [AntiSamy](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/AntiSamy) or the [Java HTML Sanitizer Project](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Java_HTML_Sanitizer_Project).
