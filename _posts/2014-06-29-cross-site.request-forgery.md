Synopsis
--------------
CSRF is an attack which forces an end user to execute unwanted actions on a web application in which he/she is currently authenticated.

Description
------------------
CSRF attack occurs when a malicious Web site, email, blog, instant message, or program causes a userâ€™s Web browser to perform an unwanted action on a trusted site for which the user is currently authenticated. CSRF attacks generally target functions that cause a state change on the server but can also be used to access sensitive data.

Mitigation
---------------

- The preferred option is to include the unique token in a hidden field. This causes the value to be sent in the body of the HTTP request, avoiding its inclusion in the URL, which is more prone to exposure.

- The unique token can also be included in the URL itself, or a URL parameter. However, such placement runs a greater risk that the URL will be exposed to an attacker, thus compromising the secret token.

- Requiring the user to reauthenticate, or prove they are a user (e.g., via a CAPTCHA) can also protect against CSRF.
