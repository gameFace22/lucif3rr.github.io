Introduction to vulnerability report
==================================

Below are the reports which contain the vulneribilty information and also steps to prevent it.Added to it is the CVSS Base score of each vulnerability.
Each one of the reported vulnerabilities have the ability to obtain control over the system,elevate privileges or obtain information about the vulnerable host. 
These exposures may also be used as stepping-stone towards gaining access to the system themselves.

Following are the links which contain reports for all the vulnerabilities mentioned in OWASP:
