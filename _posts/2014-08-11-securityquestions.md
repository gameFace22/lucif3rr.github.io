Using Security questions
-->
Synopsis
---------------
There should be some best practice for developers to follow when choosing and using security questions to implement a "forgot password" web application.

Description
-----------------
There is no industry standard either for providing guidance to users or developers when using or implementing a Forgot Password feature. The result is that developers generally pick a set of dubious questions and implement them insecurely. 
Any security question should be memorable, safe, nearly universal and consistent.

Mitigation
---------------
* Review any canned questions with your legal department or privacy officer and decide on Identity Data vs Canned Questions vs. User-Created Questions.

* Periodically Have Your Users Review their questions and update them.
