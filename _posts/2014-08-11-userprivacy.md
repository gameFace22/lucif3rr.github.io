Synopsis
---------------
User privacy protection focuses on privacy and anonymity threats that users might face by using online services, especially in contexts such as social networking and communication platforms. 

Description
-----------------
This introduces mitigation methods that web developers may utilize in order to protect their users from a vast array of potential threats and aggressions that might try to undermine their privacy and anonymity. It is a company's prime responsibility to confirm and provide privacy protection.


Mitigation
---------------
* Any online platform that handles user identities, private information or communications must be secured with the use of strong cryptography. Ensure usage of TLS/SSL and verified certificates.
* Usage of panic mode. A panic mode is a mode that threatened users can refer to when they fall under direct threat to disclose account credentials. 
* If a user equipment is stolen or under suspicion of cookie theft; it might be very beneficial for users to able to see view their current online sessions and disconnect/invalidate it.
* Prevent IP leakage and allow connections from anonymity networks.
