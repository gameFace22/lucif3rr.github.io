title: Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
---

Synopsis
--------------
CSRF is an attack which forces an end user to execute unwanted actions on a web application in which he/she is currently authenticated.

Description:
------------------
CSRF attack occurs when a malicious Web site, email, blog, instant message, or program causes a userâ€™s Web browser to perform an unwanted action on a trusted site for which the user is currently authenticated. CSRF attacks generally target functions that cause a state change on the server but can also be used to access sensitive data.

Mitigation
---------------
Using a Synchronizer Token is one way that an application can rely upon the Same-Origin Policy to prevent CSRF by maintaining a secret token to authenticate requests.
