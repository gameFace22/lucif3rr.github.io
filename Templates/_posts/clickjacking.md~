Synopsis:
----------------
Clickjacking (UI redress attack) happens when an attacker uses multiple transparent or opaque layers to trick a user into clicking on a button or link on another page when they were intending to click on the the top level page. 

Description:
----------------------
Clickjacking is a malicious technique that consists of deceiving a web user into interacting with something different to what the user believes they are interacting with. It can be used in combination with other attacks, which could potentially send unauthorized commands or reveal confidential information while the victim is interacting on seemingly harmless web pages.

Mitigation:
-----------------
Include "frame-breaking" functionality which prevents other web pages from framing the site you wish to defend.
