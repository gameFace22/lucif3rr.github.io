Title: SQL Injection
---

Synopsis:
----------------
SQL injection attacks are a type of injection attack, in which SQL commands are injected into data-plane input in order to effect the execution of predefined SQL commands.

Description:
-------------------
A successful SQL injection exploit can read sensitive data from the database,accept data from an untrusted internet source,modify the data, execute administrative operations on the database(shutting down the DBMS),recover the content of a given file present on the DBMS file system and in certain cases issue commands to the operating system.

Mitigation:
----------------
- Sanitize the input(such as MySQL' mysql_real_escape_string() function) to ensure dangerous characters such as "'" are not passed.

- Use persistence layers such as Hibernate or Enterprise Java Beans, which ensure protection against SQL injection if used properly.

- Check server logs in a regular basis to verify that no one pokes you with malicious codes.

- Use a WAF(Web Application Firewall) to filter out malicious data.

- Encrypt or hash passwords and other confidential data including connection strings.
