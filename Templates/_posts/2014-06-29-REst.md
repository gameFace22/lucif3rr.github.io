Title: REpresentational State Transfer
---

Synopsis:
----------------
REST allows interaction with a web-based system via simplified URL's rather than complex request body or POST parameters to request specific items from the system.

Description:
------------------ 
REST is a means of expressing specific entities in a system by URL path elements, REST is not an architecture but it is an architectural style to build services on top of the Web. REST allows interaction with a web-based system via simplified URL's rather than complex request body or POST parameters.

Mitigation:
----------------
*RESTful web services should use session based authentication, either by establishing a session token via a POST, or using an API key as a POST body argument or as a cookie.Sensitive information should not appear in the URL.
BAD PRACTICE : https://example.com/controller/<id>/action?apiKey=a53f435643de32

*Use a secure parser for parsing incoming messages.

*XML Input Validation must ensure that they are protected against common XML based attacks by using XML-Parsing.

*The client should send an X-Frame-Options which in turn protects drag'n drop clickjacking attacks.

*Insecure Direct object reference : It may seem obvious, but if you had a bank account REST web service,
https://example.com/account/325365436/transfer?amount=$100.00&toAccount=473846376 
In this case, it would be possible to transfer money from any account to any other account. Not even a random token makes this safe.
https://example.com/invoice/2362365 
In this case, it would be possible to get a copy of all invoices.
