title: XPath Injection
---

Synopsis:
----------------
XPath Injection attacks occur when a web site uses user-supplied information to construct an XPath query for XML data.

Description:
--------------------
By sending intentionally malformed information as input, an attacker can find out how the XML data is structured, or access data that cannot be normally accessed. The attackerâ€™s privileges on the web site can be elevated if the XML data is being used for authentication (such as an XML based user file).

Mitigation:
----------------
Use parameterized XPath queries (e.g. using XQuery). This will help ensure separation between data plane and control plane. Use an "accept known good" input validation strategy, i.e., use a whitelist of acceptable inputs that strictly conform to specifications.
