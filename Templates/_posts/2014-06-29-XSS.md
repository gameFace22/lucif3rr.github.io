title: Cross site scripting (XSS)
---
Synopsis:
---------------
Cross site scripting is a vulnerability in which malicious scripts are injected into the websites which can lead to a total breach of security when customer details are stolen or manipulated.

Description: 
------------------
XSS can be found anywhere in an application where user input has been taken but not properly encoded. The injected script will be sent to users when the browser executes the script, and a malicious action is performed on the client side.
