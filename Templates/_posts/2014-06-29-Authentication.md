title: Authentication & Sessions
---

Synopsis
---------------
Authentication is the act of establishing something (or someone) as authentic, to check that claims made by or about the thing are true. Session Management is a process by which a server maintains the state of an entity interacting with it.

Description
-----------------
Authentication is commonly performed by submitting a username or ID and one or more items of private information that only the user should know. 
To know more about authentication guidelines, see:- [OWASP Guide](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Guide_to_Authentication).

Sessions are maintained on the server by a session identifier which can be passed back and forward between the client and server when transmitting and receiving requests. 

Mitigation
---------------
The primary recommendation for an organization is to make available to developers:

1) A single set of strong authentication and session management controls. Such controls should strive to:
meet all the authentication and session management requirements defined in OWASPâ€™s [Application Security Verification](http://www.owasp.org/index.php/ASVS#tab=Downloads) Standard (ASVS) areas V2 (Authentication) and V3 (Session Management).

2) Have a simple interface for developers. Consider the [ESAPI Authenticator and User APIs](http://owasp-esapi-java.googlecode.com/svn/trunk_doc/latest/org/owasp/esapi/Authenticator.html) as good examples to emulate, use, or build upon.

For authentication, some guidelines are to be followed like giving proper usernames and passwords. See:- [ Authentication General Guidelines](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Authentication_Cheat_Sheet#Authentication_General_Guidelines)

Session management is directly related to authentication. For more guidelines on session management, see:-[ Session Management cheatsheet](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Session_Management_Cheat_Sheet)
